                            The idea for Ech‚Äôija was first conceived in 2005, but it wasn‚Äôt until 2019 that the dream became
                            a reality. Driven by a collective of passionate Idoma youths‚Äîmost notably Amedu Davinci Iklaga‚Äî
                            the festival was founded as a platform to reconnect young people with their roots while showcasing
                            the beauty, wisdom, and creativity of Idoma culture.

                            creative empowerment, attracting thousands of participants and spectators from across Nigeria and beyond.
